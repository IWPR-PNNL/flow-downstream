# Welcome to flow

## Background
The dependencies of the water sector on energy and the energy sector on water can lead to multi-faceted and multi-scale vulnerabilities and risks that are further exacerbated in a changing climate. Whether it is threats to water availability for electricity generation or public water supply sources facing the impacts of a power disruption event, the crossovers and interconnections between water and energy are ubiquitous and can have large impacts. While previous research has explored energy-water interconnection visualizations and data at the country-, state-, or even application-level for the U.S., this notebook calculates flows at the U.S. electricity grid interconnection scale.

This package was created to:
* Reflect the flows between and within the water and energy sectors
* Provide informed high-level water-energy dependency insights,
* Identify the relative intensities between the water and energy sectors across and within regions, and
* Identifiy opportunities and or risks related to stemming from the interdependencies between water and energy

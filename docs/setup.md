## Configuration File

The **flow** package uses a YAML configuration file that can be customized to provide a path to input data, a path to save output data (if desired), and a path to a json file containing geospatial data to visualize output for the regions included in the input data if desired. flow comes preset with a configuration file containing paths to the US 2015 County Level sample dataset contained within the data folder of the package, an path to deposit data into the output folder, and a path to a json file for US Counties contained within the data folder.
